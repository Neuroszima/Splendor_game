# Splendor_game

### Aims of the project
Side project mainly focused on digitizing the board game "Splendor"
Some time ago i have made an attempt to create such version of the game, but lack of knowledge and will quickly dealt 
with my motivation to continue this side activity. Now i came back and resurected the past repository writing double
the amount of code (at the start of *this very repository*), with inclusion of several tests, simple and more complex
to get the idea if what i do so far falls within bounds created by the rules of the game itself.

### Why this board game?
It is complex enough and at the same time simple enough to test me on various different components. What does this game feature?
1. token system with total amount spread across 2 - 4 different players.
2. turn-based decision-making system
3. cards with different statistics
4. buying cards - price checks - with the use of wildcard tokens in addition to normal ones
5. win condition based on simple point system

### Future plans for project?
For now i am not going to make any promises. Making promises and thinking in long term plans when the base game isn't fully ready
isn't going to help, and only will create pressure and dscourage me from working on the project, looking at TODO sections everywhere in
the files. For now i will focus on this first, and the playability.
( that doesn't mean i don't have plans for future :) )
